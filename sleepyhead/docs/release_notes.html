<h1><image src="qrc:/docs/sheep.png" width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.9.4 <b>BETA</b></h1>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>For a lot of you, this is a minor interim release mainly to bring the various platform builds in sync again and fix a couple of crashes.<br/>
To native Mac users this is a fairly large update because you missed out on the last one, if you weren't using the windows one in Parallels/etc.... (Thanks for being so patient!)</p>

<p>Oximetry importing support has been improved, so now you should be able to import directly from your CMS50X oximeters without messing around with the windows software.<br/>
Please remember, for achieving the best sync, always start your oximeter at the same time as your CPAP machine!</br>

<p>I (Jedimark) am so very greatful for those who have stepped up to help out while I've been out of action.
Also like to thank</p>

<b>New features & bugs fixes in this Update:</b><br/>

<list>
<li>Improved CMS50 Oximetry serial importing</li>
<li>Printing works on Mac OSX 10.8.x again</li>
<li>Support for the PRS1 Series 60, in large part due to a patch from Keary Griffin.</li>
<li>A bunch of small PRS1 fixes, especially for the AutoSV.</li>
