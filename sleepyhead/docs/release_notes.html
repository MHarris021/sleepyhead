<h1><image src="qrc:/docs/sheep.png" width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.9.4 <b>BETA</b></h1>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>A long time in the making, but better late than never, here is a new and hopefully improved SleepyHead build.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this build is to bring all SleepyHead's platform releases back into sync.</p>
<p>To native Mac users this is a fairly large update because you missed out on the last one, if you weren't using the windows one in Parallels/etc.... (Thanks for being so patient!)</p>
<p>Oximetry importing support has been improved, so now you should be able to import directly from your CMS50X oximeters without messing around with the windows software.<br/>
Please remember, for achieving the best sync, always start your oximeter at the same time as your CPAP machine!</br>
<p>Fisher & Paykel Icon users should have a better experience, as SleepyHead now imports flow waveform (and I'm not even sure the last build worked properly!)</p>

<p>I am extremly grateful for those who have stepped up to help out while I've been out of action. I'm glad to report I'm now fully back into the action.</p>
