<p>To import your PRS1 or S9 CPAP data, select either the root or drive letter of the SD card, or any folder containing a copy of it.
On the PRS1 this folder should either contain or be the P-Series folder.. For the S9, the folder you select must contain the DATALOG folder, and Journal.dat, etc..</p>
<p><b>ResMed S9 Users Please Note:</b> It's a good idea to keep a running backup of your DATALOG folder as your machine automatically deletes Flow waveform data past 7 days, and other waveforms after 30 days.</p>
<p><b>CMS50 users:</b> To import data recorded by the SpO2Review software, look for the "Application Data" folder in your Home directory, point at the folder containing the Spo2.ini, Spo2Review.ini and Data folder.
Serial importing is still a work in progress and may or may not behave how you would expect.</p>
<p><b>*** Attention Mac Users ***</b><br/><i> Please set your SD card to read-only before inserting it into your computer,
as Mac OSX automatically writes a hidden index file, which can lead to data corruption on your SD card.</i></p>
