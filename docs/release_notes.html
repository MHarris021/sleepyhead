<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Hi There!</p>
<p>Thanks for bearing with us this year - it has been a crazy year for some of us, and we're thankful for a few who have stepped up to help out.  Anyone who wants to contribue to SleepyHead (whether with code, documentation, or just helping those with questions), please contact us or post one one of the lists/forums on our website.</p>
<b>New features & bugs fixes in this Update:</b></br>
<list>
<li>Impproved Auto-Updater previously released in a test release.</li>
<li>Support for the PRS1 Series 60, in large part due to a patch from Keary Griffin.</li>
<li>A bunch of small PRS1 fixes, especially for the AutoSV.</li>
<li>Added Flow Limit to the summary and overview screens.  This can be a useful indicator in certain types of apnea.</li>
<li>Some 64-bit fixes, and some other bugfixes mainly useful to those building from source, especially on linux.</li>
<li>Added Melbourne as a timezone option.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with the prescription changes table with certain machines.</li>
</list>
<p><b>Would you like to help test breaky stuff?</b></p>
<p>Advanced users who are willing, can now help test future updates, so we can hopefully avoid unleashing unintentonally buggy versions on everyone else.</p>
<p>There is an option in General Preferences that tells the updater to look at potentially breaky experimental & test builds.</p>
<p>If your experiencing a specific bug or problem I might occasionally ask you to switch this setting on so I can deliver a custom fix for you to test.</p>
<p>Please always read the release notes carefully before accepting an update with experimental/test builds switched on.</p>

<p><b>Sleep Well, and have fun!</b></p>
