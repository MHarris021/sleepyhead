<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>For a lot of you, this is a minor interim release mainly to bring the various platform builds in sync again and fix a couple of crashes.<br/>
To native Mac users this is a fairly large update because you missed out on the last one, if you weren't using the windows one in Parallels/etc.... (Thanks for being so patient!)</p>

<p>There is one caveat for this release on native Mac though, printing had to be disabled due to a change in MacOSX that broke something in the QT libraries which causes a consistent crash.
That bug is fixed in the next version of Qt, but something else broke there that's way worse.. Still waiting on upstream for a fix.
Hopefully next time I can switch it back on, but the feedback I've received indicates a lot of you would rather still have the software without it for now.<br/>

<p>Oximetry importing support has been improved, so now you should be able to import directly from your CMS50X oximeters without messing around with the windows software.<br/>
Please remember, for achieving the best sync, always start your oximeter at the same time as your CPAP machine!</br>

<p>I (Jedimark) am so very greatful for those who have stepped up to help out while I've been out of action.
Also like to thank</p>
